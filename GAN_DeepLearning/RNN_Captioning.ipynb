To cut down on processing time and memory requirements, we have reduced the dimensionality of the features from 4096 to 512; these features can be found in the files `train2014_vgg16_fc7_pca.h5` and `val2014_vgg16_fc7_pca.h5`.\n","\n","The raw images take up a lot of space (nearly 20GB) so we have not included them in the download.
